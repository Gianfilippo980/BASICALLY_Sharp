# BASICALLY_Sharp
Jut a repository to store my BASIC programs for the Sharp Pocket Computer line.

I own bot a PC-1360 and a PC-1211, but the repository is going to be mostly about the 1360, so, if you happen to have one, feel free to download it.
When it comes to itnerfacing the PC-1360 with a modern computer, you can use the serial interfce, in addition to the classical cassette tape one, if you are interested in building your serial adaptor, I recomend this forum: http://www.silicium.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=42285&sid=e9e98857a5478a4c144924ba9b246c79
